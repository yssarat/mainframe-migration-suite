# Changes from Original Project

## Modifications

1. **DynamoDB Record Storage Enhancement**
   - **File:** `src/initial-lambda/lambda_function.py`
   - **Change:** Modified the `create_job_record` function to store all files in the DynamoDB record instead of just the first 10 files
   - **Line:** Changed `'file_list': files[:10]` to `'file_list': files`
   - **Purpose:** This change allows the system to display information about all processed files in the DynamoDB record, not just the first 10

## Impact

- **Improved Visibility:** Users can now see all files being processed in the DynamoDB record
- **Storage Considerations:** This change may increase the size of DynamoDB records, especially for jobs with many files
- **Processing Behavior:** The actual processing of files remains unchanged - the system was already processing all files (up to the MaxFilesPerJob limit)

## Notes

- The original 10-file limitation in the DynamoDB record was likely for display/storage efficiency reasons, not a processing limitation
- The system can still process up to 100 files per job (configurable via the MaxFilesPerJob parameter)
- No changes were needed to the Step Functions workflow as it was already receiving and processing all files
